I came up with this on my own on the date this repository was created. 
If you want to re-use or publish my work, I ask for a citation and 10% 
of any money made from use of this algorithm if the money made exceeds
1,000 USD as of today's CPI (Consumer Price Index). That is to adjust for inflation.
